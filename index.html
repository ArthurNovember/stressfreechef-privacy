  <h1>Privacy Policy – StressFreeChef</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025</p>

  <p>
    StressFreeChef (“the App”) is developed and maintained by an individual developer. 
    The App allows users to view recipes, create personal recipes, manage a shopping list,
    and save user preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1. Account Information</h3>
  <p>
    If you create an account, we store your email address and a securely hashed password.
  </p>

  <h3>2. User-Generated Content</h3>
  <p>
    The App stores recipes, favorites, shopping list items, and other personal data you create. 
    This data is linked to your account. You maintain full control over your content and may delete it at any time within the App.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Device Permissions</h3>
  <p>The App may request the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone</strong> – used only for the “blow-to-next-step” feature. Audio is not recorded, saved, or transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera / Gallery</strong> – used when users upload recipe images.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Automatically Collected Data</h3>
  <p>
    We do not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, tracking data, or any data unrelated to providing the core app functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is used solely to provide the main functionality of the App — such as saving recipes,
    managing your shopping list, and supporting features like microphone-based navigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Removal</h2>
  <p>
    All user data is stored securely in our backend. You may request complete deletion of your account
    and all associated data by emailing:
  </p>
  <p><strong>stressfreechef@gmail.com</strong></p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 years old.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available here.
  </p>
